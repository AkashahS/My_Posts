Are you wondering what Machine learning is? Here is an easy and non-technical explanation of the most frequent terms used in Machine learning.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial intelligence is mimicking human intelligence in machines. Humans can speak, read, write, learn, move and much more. When computers can perform such tasks, it is called Artificial intelligence. 

{: .box-note}
“AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” — John McCarthy.

AI is frequently used interchangeably with ML, but artificial intelligence is a broader term.  Some facts about AI that will help you understand it better are as follows: 

- ML is a branch of AI
- The goal of AI is not to make an intelligent robot, but an intelligent robot is one of the applications of AI.

## Machine Learning (ML)

Machine learning is an imitation of human learning. It makes computers capable of automatically learning from data and improve from experience.
Machines can intelligently answer different types of problems just like humans. 

- Yes/No Questions: like Is this email spam or not? Is this car blue or not? In ML language yes/no problem is called a *binary classification problem*.  
- Options Questions: For example, is this spam or an important email? Is this car blue or red? Options can be two or more. Like, Is this car blue or red or yellow?In machine learning these problems are called *multi-class classification problems*.
- Specific Questions: Like, How much does the house costs? What is the allocated budget for fuel? When an answer is not as discrete as yes/no or any particular group, in other words, it is a continuous variable then the problem is called a *regression problem*.
