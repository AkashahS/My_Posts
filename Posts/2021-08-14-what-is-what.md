Are you wondering what Machine learning is? Here is an easy and non-technical explanation of the most frequent terms used in Machine learning.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial intelligence is mimicking human intelligence in machines. Humans can speak, read, write, learn, move and much more. When computers can perform such tasks, it is called Artificial intelligence.

“AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” — John McCarthy.

AI is frequently used interchangeably with ML, but artificial intelligence is a broader term.  Some facts about AI that will help you understand it better are as follows: 

- ML is a branch of AI
- The goal of AI is not to make an intelligent robot, but an intelligent robot is one of the applications of AI.

## Machine Learning (ML)

Machine learning is an imitation of human learning. It makes computers capable of automatically learning from data and improve from experience.
